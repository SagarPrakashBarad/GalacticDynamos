    "This is essentially the step zero of the simulation to non dimensional the differential equation.Nondimensionalization allows us to focus on the relative importance of different terms in the equations and simplifies the interpretation of the results. It also helps in comparing simulations across different scales and systems. To nondimensionalize the given equations, we'll scale each parameter by equivalent units to obtain a set of dimensionless quantities. This ensures that parameters of vastly different magnitudes can be treated uniformly, which is particularly useful for simulations. Let's denote the scaling factors as ( $R_o$ ) for radial distance, ( $h$ ) for axial distance, and $\\frac{\\eta}{h^2}$  for time. The dimensional variables are denoted by $(r, z, t)$, while the nondimensional variables are denoted by ($\\tilde{r}, \\tilde{z}, \\tilde{t}$).\n",

    "In this approximation, we neglect all radial derivatives and solve the equations only for the axial direction  $\\tilde{z}$. This simplifies the equations significantly and is applicable when variations in the radial direction are much smaller compared to the axial direction, such as in thin disk systems. In this approximation, we solve the equations in the radial direction $\\tilde{r}$ but approximate the axial derivative $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\tilde{z}}$. This is commonly done in situations where the system has a dominant axial symmetry, such as in spiral galaxies where the thin disk approximation is valid.\n",
