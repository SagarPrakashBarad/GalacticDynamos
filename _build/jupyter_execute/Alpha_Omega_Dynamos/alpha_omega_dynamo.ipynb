    "Solve the mean-field $\\alpha-\\Omega$ dynamo equations in the kinematic regime. That is, include the $\\Omega$ effect term in the equation for $\\dfrac{\\partial \\bar{B}_\\phi}{\\partial t}$ and the $\\alpha$ effect term in the equation for $\\dfrac{\\partial \\bar{B}_r}{\\partial t}$. This requires specifying the overall magnitude and spatial dependence of $\\Omega$ and $\\alpha$.\n",

    "$$ D = − \\dfrac{\\alpha_0 q \\Omega h^3}{\\eta_t^2} $$\n",
    "where $q = − \\dfrac{d \\ln \\Omega}{d \\ln r}$ and $\\alpha_0 > 0$ is the amplitude of the $\\alpha$ effect. Note that $q > 0$ if $\\Omega$ decreases with $r$, which is generally the case in galaxies, so $D < 0$.\n",

    "We begin by adopting the simplest approximation to the mean field dynamo equations, treating the system as a flat rotating thin disc. This assumption implies that the aspect ratio, denoted by $\\epsilon = \\frac{h_o}{R_o}$, where $h_o$ is the disc thickness and $R_o$ is its radius, is much less than 1, allowing us to neglect all terms involving $\\epsilon^2$, along with any radial derivatives associated with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under this approximation, we seek a local solution in the $z$ direction for specific values of $\\phi$ and $r$. Our mean field dynamo equation is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial \\bar{\\mathbf{B}}}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\times \\left[ \\bar{\\mathbf{V}} \\times \\bar{\\mathbf{B}} + \\mathcal{E} - \\eta \\left( \\nabla \\times \\bar{\\mathbf{B}} \\right) \\right]\n",

    "where $\\mathcal{E} = \\left( \\alpha \\bar{\\mathbf{B}} \\right) - \\eta_t \\left( \\nabla \\times \\bar{\\mathbf{B}} \\right)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify the equations further, we make the following approximations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We consider the velocity field $\\bar{\\mathbf{V}}$ to be of the form:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{\\bar{V}} = \\bar{V}_r(r) \\mathbf{\\hat{r}} + r \\Omega(r) \\mathbf{\\hat{\\phi}} + \\bar{V}_z(r, z) \\mathbf{\\hat{z}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Here, $\\bar{V}_r$, $\\Omega$, and $\\bar{V}_z$ represent the radial, azimuthal, and vertical components of the velocity field, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We take the turbulent magnetic diffusivity, $\\eta_T$, to be independent of $\\bar{\\mathbf{B}}$. This simplifies our equation to:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\boxed{ \\frac{\\partial \\bar{\\mathbf{B}}}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\times \\left( \\bar{\\mathbf{V}} \\times \\bar{\\mathbf{B}} \\right) + \\nabla \\times \\left(\\alpha \\bar{\\mathbf{B}} \\right) - \\eta_T \\left( \\nabla \\times \\nabla \\times \\bar{\\mathbf{B}} \\right) }\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Solving the equations in cylindrical coordinates and assuming azimuthal symmetry, we derive the equations for $\\bar{B}_r$ and $\\bar{B}_{\\phi}$ as:\n",

    "4. Utilizing the $\\alpha-\\Omega$ approximation and defining $q = -\\dfrac{\\partial \\ln \\Omega}{\\partial \\ln r} = -\\dfrac{r}{\\Omega} \\dfrac{\\partial \\Omega}{\\partial r}$, we obtain the simplified equations:\n",

    "\n",
    "Here, we have neglected all terms involving $\\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial r}$ in $\\bar{B}$ and omitted the $\\alpha^2$ term for simplicity. The parameter $S$ represents the shear rate and is defined as $S = r \\dfrac{\\partial \\Omega}{\\partial r}$. For a flat rotation curve, $S = -\\Omega$, where $\\Omega_{0}$ and $S_{0}$ are their values at $r = R_o$. Additionally, the $\\alpha$-coefficient has a functional dependence of $\\alpha \\simeq l_{0}^{2} \\Omega / h_{0}$.\n",

Additionally, we identify the radial positions on the discs where this possibility occurs.\n",
